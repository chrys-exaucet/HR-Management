# HR Stakeout
Human resources management system leveraged by  Spring Boot, Atlas and RabbitMQ.
Rest Endpoint description  available at https://localhost:your-port/swagger-ui/index.html

## Prerequisites
[Have an Atlas account](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/create-atlas-account/)

 ## Usage
 Connect your Atlas cluster to Springboot.
 Follow instructions [here](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/connect-to-cluster/)
 Make sure you change the  [application.yml](https://github.com/chrys-exaucet/Human-Ressources-Management-System/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.yml) file accordingly. 
 Also, remember allowing your [whitelist](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/connect-to-cluster/#whitelist) cluster to discover the IP address from which you send requests.

You sense that we should add a stunning front-end side to the app? I do too. :-)
